Machine Learning Projects
These projects were developed as part of my exploration and learning journey in the field of machine learning. They serve as foundational exercises that helped me understand essential concepts and tools. Through these projects, I gained proficiency in using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and others. Below, I have outlined the basic workflows of the projects included in the repository.

1. Rock vs Mine Detection
Objective: Predict whether an object is a rock or a mine based on sonar data.

Workflow:

Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values and normalized the data.
Data Splitting: Split the data into training and testing sets (80-20 split).
Model: Logistic Regression for binary classification.
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn.

Results and Impact:

Achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test set, indicating good model performance in distinguishing between rocks and mines.
Challenges and Solutions:

Challenge: Imbalanced dataset.
Solution: Used stratified sampling to ensure balanced classes in training and test sets.
Learning Outcomes:

Gained insights into handling imbalanced datasets and the importance of data normalization.
2. Diabetes Prediction Model
Objective: Predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on medical attributes.

Workflow:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned the data and handled missing values.
Data Standardization: Standardized the features for consistent scaling.
Data Splitting: Split the data into training and testing sets (75-25 split).
Model: Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for prediction.
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn.

Results and Impact:

Achieved an accuracy of 78% on the test set, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in predicting diabetes.
Challenges and Solutions:

Challenge: High dimensionality of data.
Solution: Used feature selection techniques to retain the most informative features.
Learning Outcomes:

Enhanced understanding of feature selection and the importance of standardization in SVM models.
3. Spam Mail Detection
Objective: Classify emails as spam or not spam.

Workflow:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned the text data and removed stopwords.
Feature Engineering: Converted text to numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization.
Data Splitting: Split the data into training and testing sets (70-30 split).
Model: Logistic Regression for binary classification.
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn.

Results and Impact:

Achieved an accuracy of 92% on the test set, effectively identifying spam emails.
Challenges and Solutions:

Challenge: Handling textual data.
Solution: Implemented TF-IDF vectorization for better feature representation.
Learning Outcomes:

Gained proficiency in text preprocessing and feature engineering for NLP tasks.
