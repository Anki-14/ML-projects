# ML-projects

All of this projects are made for my learning purpose as, i was exploring the field and found it as intresting , and they are all the basic building blocks for my ML learnings
i learnt about libraries like:
pandas,numpy,sklearn and many more .
Here are the basic workflows of the projects listed in the repository.

1. Rock vs mine:
   workflow:
     raw data-->data preprocessing-->splitting data as training and testing data-->logistic regression-->prediction .
2. Diabetes prediction model:
   workflow:
     raw data--> data preprocessing-->data standardzation-->train test split-->svm classifier-->prediction.
3. Spam mail detection:
   workflow:
     raw data-->data preprocessing-->splitting data as train and test data-->feature engineering(text to numbers conversion)-->logistic regression-->prediction.
